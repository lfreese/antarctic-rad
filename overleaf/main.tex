{\textsc{Abstract.} }
Greenhouse gases (GHG), such as \ce{CO2}, impact global and local outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The Antarctic is known for its a strong temperature inversion, where the addition of GHG can lead to increased OLR due to higher radiating temperatures higher in the atmosphere. Here we develop a simple radiative-advective-turbulence single-column model based on observed temperatures at the South Pole and timestep it forward under different \ce{CO2} concentrations. We discuss 1. stratosphere vs. troposphere role; 2. surface longwave flux under varying CO2 concentrations; 3. when time stepped, surface LW radiation and OLR do xyz. This basic single column model could be broadened across multiple sites throughout Antarctica elucidate further understandings of the negative greenhouse effect.

\section{Introduction}
The Antarctic is characterized by a strong, year-round temperature inversion in the bottom 1 kilometer of the atmosphere. This is in contrast to the rest of the planet, such that surface temperatures, particularly in the central part of the continent, are colder than atmospheric temperatures just above them\citep{hudson_look_2005}. As emissions of \ce{CO_2} continue to rise due anthropogenic sources, the role that greenhouse gases (GHG) play in local Antarctic radiative balance, where such a temperature inversion is present, are important to consider.

Previous work has found that GHG emissions under a temperature inversion cause atmospheric longwave radiation to be less than the surface longwave emissions. This in turn leads to an increase in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and a cooling of the Antarctic atmosphere, due to radiative effects alone\citep{schmithusen_how_2015}. This was seen in a two-box model, line-by-line radiative transfer calculations, and experiments with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) atmospheric model. These conclusions; however, do not describe the impact that GHG have on surface temperature or the structure of the atmospheric column temperature. In order to investigate the implications that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) would have in the Antarctic, \cite{flanner_climate_2018} utilize Community Earth System Model (CESM), a fully coupled atmosphere, ocean, and land model, to model the surface and atmospheric temperature response. This work finds warming surface temperatures, and cooling in the layer in which CFCs were emitted. Theoretical work utilizing a grey gas model similarly found increasing surface temperatures in response to increased optical depth in a high latitude scenario \citep{payne_conceptual_2015}.

We aim to bring together much of this work by developing a single-column radiative-advective model rooted in observations, in order to build upon the theoretical findings in high latitude scenarios, and to investigate column response to increased levels of \ce{CO_2} both initially, and over time. We analyze 1) the surface, column, and top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative and temperature responses to different \ce{CO_2} levels at an initial time and 2) the changes in these responses over the span of three months. We find that OLR responses are dependent upon season, surface net longwave fluxes decrease with increasing GHG concentration, and that surface temperature and OLR under higher GHG concentrations are larger after 3 months.


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Temperature and gas data}
 To create monthly column gas and temperature profiles, we utilize monthly average temperature profiles from the South Pole station, modified according to Schmith√ºsen et al., as well as yearly average ozone volumetric mixing ratio (vmr), and water vapor vmr (w) from their study  \citep{schmithusen_how_2015}. The column specific humidity is calculated at every level using
\begin{equation}
    q = w/1+w
\end{equation}

 We adjust the lowest levels of the temperature, ozone, and specific humidity profile to measure one reading every 100m in order to satisfy the CFL condition of $\frac{\kappa_0*timestep}{dz^2_{surf}}$, where our timestep is one hour. Six column CO2 profiles are created, at 100, 200, 380, 760, 1000, and 1500 ppm, in order to give a full range of responses to different values.

\subsection{Model Setup}
We utilize these monthly temperature profiles in a single column model in CLIMLAB \citep{rose_climlab_2018}, an open source python climate model. We adjust the solar insolation to a monthly mean insolation, to capture the variability in shortwave radiation in summer and winter seasons in the Antarctic. 

Our single-column model is comprised of three part: a radiative, an advective, and a turbulent component. The radiation is calculated utilizing an RRTMG radiation scheme (\linkhttp{http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html}). 

We construct an exponentially decaying turbulent component according to
\begin{equation}
    F_{turb} = -\kappa_0*exp(-\frac{z}{d})*\frac{d\theta}{dz}
\end{equation}
Where $\kappa_0$ is a surface turbulent diffusivity, scaled exponentially over the height of the column, and $d$ is a scale factor of 100 meters. We calculate an initial monthly $\kappa_0$ as
\begin{equation}
    \kappa_0 = \frac{F_{sfc, rad}}{\frac{d\theta}{dz}_{sfc}}
\end{equation}
Where $F_{sfc, rad}$ is the surface shortwave flux minus the surface longwave flux, as we assume the total flux at the surface boundary is equal to zero. From this, we average the (nine) positive $\kappa_0$ values, and use this as our final $\kappa_0$ throughout the experiments.

The turbulent heating rate is thus the flux divergence times the specific heat and density of air and ice, for the atmosphere and surface, respectively.

\begin{equation}
    HR_{turb} = \frac{dF_{turb}}{dz} * c_p * \rho
\end{equation}

We calculate our advective heating rate based on the initial state, where it is set to equilibrate the sum of the radiative and turbulent heating rates

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dF_{adv}}{dy} = -(\frac{dF_{rad}}{dz} + \frac{dF_{turb}}{dz})
\end{equation}

This is held constant throughout time, in order to allow us to look at the adjustments of the radiative and turbulent components in time, based on an initial state. 

We run the model forward for 3 months to assess the change over time in different \ce{CO_2} scenarios.

In our initial state, we see a clear temperature inversion, as expected, across all
